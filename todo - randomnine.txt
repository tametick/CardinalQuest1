Contract:

- I'll do the bulk of design/programmming/content work on CQ2
- Ido will handle website stuff, promotion, arranging outsourcing
- I'll receive 50% net PC profit from now on

CQ1:

Newgrounds and Armor Games.

The startup animation, ad, etc. is in konghaxe.

'Use my build script. No need to rewrite the preloader I used for kong'

'In the kong-haxe directory, there's a FlashDevelop project file.
It copies over the SWF from ../bin and runs it to test the start up
animation, ads, etc. Once you've run it once and the SWF is copied
properly you can use the haxe build script to package it in a single
.swf that is ready for deployment. (haxe build.hxml)'

Fix:

1. Kong start up animation, replace with the other portal's animation
2. replace the 'Play more games at Kongregate' GIF
3. Kongregate ad that shows after the startup animation
4. Kongregate ad that shows on gameover
5. Change link in preloader to stop pointing at kongregate.
6. Change links in main game to stop pointing at kongregate.

Armor wants the ads replaced with their logo.

NG wants their branding where Kongregate's was, and wants their ad
API implemented (hrgh oh god). (Mike from NG is 'herschel' on #cq-dev)

So Armor Games:
- comment out the Kong ads + replace with branding
- replace the portal animation
- replace the More Games gif

CQ2:

- look at different generators
  - cave: src\generators\CellularAutomata.hx
  - town: http://yehieli.info/fotf/fotf.jar
