***** Rendering Overview *****

* HgGame has a _screen (Sprite) and a buffer (Bitmap)
* HgGame adds _screen to its children
* _screen adds buffer to its children
* buffers bitmap data is assigned to HgGraphics.buffer, objects draw to this
* On update, buffer is wiped, and objects use copyPixels to render onto buffer

***** DONE *****


***** TODO *****
* try to solve flicker of water in zoomed-in mode

* precalc & cache sprite flips (one horizontal for movement & one vertical for super-mario style death animations)

* walking bob

* put small sprites at the bottom and center of tile

* AStar

* enemies

* Implement display of update, render, flixel and flash times from console

* Implement toggle which auto sets active to false if sprite is off screen

* Add base alpha min and max property and helper function to emitter

* markFieldOfView should probably not directly manipulate tiles

* 'Bar' ui widget, works like a jquery progress bar

* 'Menu' ui widget
	- Contains MenuItem widgets
	- When active, takes focus and displays on top of everything else
	- Can optionally 'pause'
	- Allows keyboard selection (arrows keys and enter)
	- Allows mouse selection
	- MenuItems have callbacks for 'clicked'/'selected'
