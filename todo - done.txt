ToDo
----
- remove duplication of spriteNames arrays for every instance of HxlSpriteSheet's children classes.
- remove creation of a lot of unneeded annonymous objects ({}s).
- reuse arrays whenever possible .
- make sure only 1 instance of level & world exists, and reuse it for new levels/games.
Look into connecting to the Apple Scoring API..
Look into smoothing monsters out over levels

Done
----
Added compiling.txt with all the steps I performed to compile cq
Found unshaded version of the scores screen in shared dropbox ?
Added WhiteState class to the game
Allowed WhiteState to be called via F5
Tested as conclusively as I can that the API will work


Lessons
-------
Wine FlashDevelop did not work, gave up on it for now
Frickin' trace() writes in black, also, the dungeon is black ( hilarity ensues )

world classes : 

GameObject ( stats : hp, x , y )
|
|-> Actor ( functions for moving/attacking , stats : vision , speed )
|    |
|    |-> Mob ( act() function, AI ? )
|    |
|    |-> Player ( empty class )
|
|-> Loot ( empty class )
|
|-> Decoration ( functions for color and tweening )

HxlTilemap ( has _tiles and stuff
|
|-> Level ( generation is really done in cqLevel )
    * has mobs
    * has loot
    * has decorations
	
Research for saving : 
	Option 1:
	* store Level in its entirety plus currentLevelIndex ( both retrieved from World.hx or rather CqWorld.hx which derives from that )
	
Startup : 
	Main
	|=>debug mode -> GameState with class fighter( per debug ) and 
	|
	|=>mainmenustate
	   |=> "New Game" -> CreateCharState -> 
	   |
	   |=> "load Game"
